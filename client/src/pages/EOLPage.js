                It has been an amazing 4(!!!) years running this site and being
                part of this community, but both playing the game and
                maintaining the site became more of a chore than a hobby. I
                stopped playing the game months ago and it's been difficult to
                stay on top of new updates, and so I have decided to step away.
                Honestly, I continued to play the game long past the point of it
                being fun simply because I enjoyed running this site so much!

                Thank you all so, so much for all of your support over the
                years, it's been an incredible experience. I'm still so amazed
                that what started as a dumb little app grew to have over 10k
                users!! I've learned so much and I'm grateful to each and every
                one of you {`<3`}

                I'm really hoping somebody will want to pick up the mantle - if
