                It has been an amazing 4(!!!) years running this site and being
                part of this community, but both playing the game and
                maintaining the site have become more of a chore than a hobby
                and so I have made the difficult decision to step away from
                both. Honestly, I continued to play the game long past the point
                of it being fun simply because I enjoyed running this site so
                much!

                I'm really hoping somebody will want to pick up the mantle - if
                you're a developer interested in contributing, see below for
                more info.

                Thank you all so, so much for all of your support over the
                years, it's been an incredible experience. I'm still so amazed
                that what started as a dumb little app grew to have over 10k
                users!! I've learned so much and I'm grateful to each and every
                one of you {`<3`}
